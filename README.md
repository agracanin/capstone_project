# Capstone Project
The project aimed to recreate the classic board game Risk, featuring an interactive map divided into territories where players compete for global domination. The game is turn-based, and during each turn, players move through three phases: draft, attack, and reinforce. The game also includes a real-time multiplayer chat feature and a timer to manage player turns.
